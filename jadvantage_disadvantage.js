// Advantages of JavaScript
// Speed: Runs directly in the browser, making it super fast for user interactions.
// Versatility: Works on frontend (browser) and backend (Node.js), making it full-stack.
// Rich Ecosystem: Huge libraries and frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) for rapid development.
// Interactive UIs: Powers dynamic web apps with real-time updates (e.g., chat apps).
// Event-Driven Programming: Great for handling asynchronous operations.
// Community Support: Massive community and endless resources for learning and troubleshooting.

// Disadvantages of JavaScript
// Browser Compatibility Issues: Different browsers sometimes interpret JS differently.
// Security Risks: Can be vulnerable to XSS attacks if not handled correctly.
// Client-Side Dependency: Heavy use can slow down browsers on weaker devices.
// Dynamic Typing Pitfalls: Errors can go unnoticed until runtime (type mismatches).
// Too Many Frameworks/Libraries: Can be overwhelming to choose the right tools.
